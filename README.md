# Glyphicons for Bootstrap 4

 Do you miss the good old glyphicons from Bootstrap3 and want to use them on your Bootstrap4 project? I got you covered!

* All the font files are hosted in Bootstrap's CDN and the CSS file is in here, at GitHub. You don't have to download anything!

1. Link this file to your project;

 ```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feRpicoral/GlyphiconsBootstrap4/master/glyphicons.css" type="text/css">
```
3. Use normally, as you would if you were using Bootstrap 3;

 ```html
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-picture"></span>
```

* If you have problems using the GitHub link as `href`, try downloading the file to your machine/server. The same is valid to the font files (you can find the link to download in the firsts lines of the CSS file).
