# Glyphicons for Bootstrap 4

 Do you miss the good old glyphicons from Bootstrap3 and want to use them on your Bootstrap4 project? I got you covered!

* All the font files are hosted in Bootstrap's CDN. All you have to upload is this CSS file!

1. Add this CSS file to your project (feel free to rename it);
2. Link it to the HTML file you would like to use glyphicons;
4. Use normally, as you would if you were using Bootstrap 3;

If you want to have the font files on your machine/server, you can find the link to download them in the firsts lines of the CSS file.
